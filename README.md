# Pathfinding Visualization

Made with Swing


Algorithms include:
- A* Search
- Dijkstra Search
- Breadth First Search

The algorithms do not use Priority Queues or Queues, but they are still fun to visualize.

Diagonals are working in A* and Dijkstra but not implemented in BFS. For the "show values" feature to work,
manually change the cell size to something >= 40.

- Future changes include DFS, maze generation algorithms, and resizing features
